      <body {color:pink;}>
        <p class="midnight" style="color:orange">
          This p has a background of red because that is the designated style for the class of midnight. The text is aligned at the rear for the same reason. It is not affected by the body's modifier of pink because of its specific class.
         </p>
         <p style="color:purple">
            This p has a text of purple because of the style I made for it. It is not affected by the body's color for the same reason.
         `</p>
          <p name="ride"
           The background is green because the name of ride has an assigned background. It is affected by the body color because there was no assigned color.
          </p>
        ``<h1 name="ride"
            The background is green because of the color associated with the name of ride. The color was affected by the body color. This tag is bigger than the other because of the difference between the p and the h.
         `</h1>
          <p id="horror
                 Text is black because it is associated with the id of horror. It is not affected by the body color because it already has an associated color.
           </p>
