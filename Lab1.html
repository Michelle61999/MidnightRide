  <body>
  <pclass="left"{color:green}>
    This is the basic paragraph. Simply put, I made the text colored by putting it in brackets and made it veer to the left by formulating a class. It's the basic building block of a webpage.
  </p>
  <p{color:pink}>
    This is simpler than the other paragraph. This is just subracting a step and proving that I can make another <p tag
  </p>
  <pname="yellow"{color:yellow}>
    I made the name correlate with the style. The name defines the paragraph similiarly to how class defined the first.
  </p>
  <h1name="yellow"{color:yellow}>
    The h1 performs much the same as the paragraph except that it's a headline
  </h>
  <pid="last"{color:black}>
    This paragraph actually involves arranging code in a manner that I see fit. It's made by attaching the style and id to the paragraph
