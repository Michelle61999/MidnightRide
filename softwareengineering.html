        Requirements is the gathering of information: what the customer wants. Next, the Design of the logical and physical aspects of the project are laid out. It is often shown graphically. It is reviewed. Implementation is building the design to an actual software. Verification is where the software is tested by a group. Deployment is where the software is actually sent out. In Maintenence, initial issues are resolved. It is different in that it is handled by a different group that initially makes the software. The model is bad for complex projects in that it is inflexible, and a complex project might mean that more changes need to be made, making going back in steps improbable. The system is kept because it is easy to understand, has few production issues, and is easy to keep on budget.

        In the first phase of the spiral process, information is gathered. Then, risks are accessed, and a prototype is developed. In the third phase, the new software is produced and tested. Finally, the project is evaluted, with the next iteration planned. It is risk-based because the entire process is based around the elimination of risks. It is superior to the waterfall in that it is far more flexible and the steps can be interchanged.

        For Dave, the difference in development and production make it hard to engineer correct code. Anna feels like Dave is just lobbing code at her and it's hard to keep up. Anna's tools aren't sufficient because of the sheer number of servers. Automation keeps software and fixes cranked out so it's not overwhelming, and keeps development and production in the same environment. Tools allow them to quickly build and test their programs. Puppet is a configuration management tool that configures, manages, and deploys data.

        The product owner makes sure the correct features make it into the product backlog. It is the representative of the users. The scrum master makes sure that the project is progressing smoothly and everyone has the tools that they need. It's important to estimate the amount of work needed for each item because while some only need a few fixes, some are long projects. Efficiently mapping out the work makes sure that everything is done in time, and broken up, if needed. Sprints are short-term milestones that allow the team to tackle a large project in chunks. The short-term goal works to make sure that each part of the project is tested and working. The burndown chart tracks the sprint to provide the amount of work it still needs. The graphs bounce up and down, indicating growth. In the daily scrum, teammates communicate the work they have done and still have to do. The team is always in-sync. In the retrospective, the team looks back on what went wrong, and what they can do to improve.
