        The five areas that I have decided to improve on are password diversity, phone security, defense against viruses, excessive information online, and locks for sensitive information.

        Beforehand, nearly every site had the same password, and I decided to change that, making them all different. Google helped this, by suggesting long strings of letters and numbers that it would remember for me.This actually made me feel relieved, as it gave me a bad feeling to have my whole life undone by just one password. Statistically speaking, it's probable that at least one password will be guessed. This way, I don't lose all of my information.

        For a long time now, I've had the recent "Face ID" feature of Apple. It's now come to my attention that it's easily hacked. Instead, I have chosen a long, secure PIN number to replace the previous method. Phones hold our whole lives. This should help my device to be safer.

        It's been years since I've had a legit virus control program. I installed one, and made sure to scan for any that I've accrued in the past. I am looking good. Viruses can completely destroy a computer, along with leak your information. I am making sure to now do routine scans.

        I never really thought that I shared a lot of personal information online, but in hindsight, I have more than necessary. I've deleted some excess information off of some of my social media platforms, so that it's more secure. Really, anybody can log on to a public profile and see anything about you. It's up to you to filter what they can find.

        So, I keep a lot of passwords and important numbers stored on my phone, in case that I forget them. However, I neglected to protect them with a password. I made that change today, and overall, feel a lot better about things. The things that I'm keeping safe are things that could really damage me, if they came out.

        Finally, I showed what I did to my sister. She was actually pretty impressed. She's not one to keep locks on her phone, or any passwords for security reasons. She now is actually going to put a lock on her phone. This is progress, considering that she loses her phone regularly.
