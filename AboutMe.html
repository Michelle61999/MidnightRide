        Hello, my name is Michelle Foster. I'm a student of Rappahannock Community College, coming from Christopher Newport University. I'm an aspiring software engineer, that wants to work with games and apps. I've always wanted to create things. I've written stories on the side for yours. But, there's something special about the thought of engineering something that has a life to its own beyond the pages of a novel. My goals are to become more proficient with computers, maybe even come up with an idea for that app or game. I want to graduate and make my family proud. I really want to quit working as a receptionist. Really, though, the biggest aspiration I have for myself is to make myself proud. That's always been the hardest thing for myself to accomplish.
