        Michelle's intended career lies in software engineering, where she plans to generate apps and games for the public. She's always loved stories and the act of creating something, and plans to carry this over to technology.

        In her personal life, Michelle lives with her family and multiple pets. She works as a medical receptionist and student. When she has the time, she crafts stories in the vain hope of being the next Stephen King. It's not very likely.
