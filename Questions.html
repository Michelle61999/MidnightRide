        I really struggle in the beginning with script, and I do now. But, I do feel that it's a very useful language. I would recommend teaching it in the future. I think that functions and events can be difficult to understand. It can all seem very obtuse, especially when you are throwing around a lot of numbers. I liked the portability, but I would have LOVED to make apps. That's one thing that I want to do in the future.

        To be honest, any help that I could get would be great. Any sort of tuition assistance or paid internship. Things are kind of hard at home and as far as work, as recently, I quit mine because of the virus. I am more interested in programming. That high that you get is amazing. I would have done more of my assignments. That was a mistake. I would definitely keep the type of questions where you are fixing a broken code. Really, even though it was very generous to award us the bonus points, I would have awarded it without us knowing, near the end, or not have had them. I think that having the points made it very easy for me to just not do things that I should have done.

        My current plan is to get a bachelor's in computer science. It definitely was in the song, and I have definitely had to fill in missing parenthesis.

        I have experienced both. The joy that I get when a program is completed is unparalleled. But, I have also stared mutely at a screen for hours and not been able to gooogle it. However, the joy has eclipsed the staring in my mind.

        My plans have not changed. The class has made me love programming more, now I just need to apply myself. I'm extremely excited. I want to make apps and games, things people can love and use. And I'll try not to leap in the bathtub with a laptop in the meantime.
