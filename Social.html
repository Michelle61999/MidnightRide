        My final score was 1. At the beginning of this, I thought that I was very secure. I didn't put a crapload of information of myself out, I don't have my location on. Really, I thought that I was better than most people my age.

        And maybe I still am. However, I still have a lot I need to do regarding security. As my points dropped, I became consistently aware of how open my information really is. The truth is, is that you never think you'll get hacked. But, it happens everyday. The worst of your life can be exposed. So, I'll be taking further steps to protect myself.
