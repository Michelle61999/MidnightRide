        The first question equals 154 in a base 8 format. I simply divided everything by 2 until I reached a base 2 format. Then I grouped everything in three's and added the total values.
      </p>
      <p>
         The next, I got 1101 0111. I did the same method of dividing the base 10 by 2, then putting a 1 if there was a remainder.
      </p>
      <p>
        This question, I got 5D with a base of 16. I used the division method and then grouped the binary into four's and added.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this question, I got 172 with a base of 8. I just put the 16 base answer into the corresponding binary format and then grouped in three's.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this, I seperated the two digits into a set of two binary sets. That answer was 0111 1000.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this, I converted to second base and then added up the digits, which totaled to 40, with a base of 10.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this, I converted to second base and then added the digits, totaling to 72, with a base of 10.
      </p>
      <p>
        I grouped the base 8 solution into a second base binary set, and then grouped in four's, the answering totaling 63, with a base of sixteen.
      </p>
      <p>
        I converted the base 8 solution into a second base set, which equaled 1110 0001.
      </p>
      <p>
        I grouped the second base off in three's, and then added the solutions together. I got 263, with a base of 8.
      </p>
      <p>
        I grouped the binary in four's, then added. I got 2A, with a base of 16.
      </p>
      <p>
        I just added everything together. I got 77, with a base of 10.
