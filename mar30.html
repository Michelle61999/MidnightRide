      My download speed was 159.19 and my upload speed was 16.20. Our area can definitely be spotty with the network, but the rep was optomistic, and implied that they provided better service.

      I do not have FIOS, but I can confidently say that my service speed is "half fast." I have a really nice laptop, that I got recently, but it can be laggy due to problems with network. I know that this is an issue that a lot of people face, but I'm not sure how it would be fixed. Billions of people use the internet, and it's a daunting task to even think about correcting a slow network for all of them. There are dozens of companies that provide the service, with the goal of making profit. How do you maximize it if you provide great service for a great price?

      I have a 64-based, 2.30 Ghz processor, 20 GB of RAM, a 64-bit architecture, and a four cores. I have 418 GB free on my drive.

      Although it doesn't have the exact same specifications, I read about 4 background processor, 64-bit words, and a 64 gigabit memory. It also mentioned its small size and revoltionary cooling system.

      It is clear how far technology has come, and will continue to grow. Reading about the machine, revolutionary things seem basic and rudimentary. It looks huge and clunky, with a tiny memory and next to no processer. The laptops of today can be fit into a backpack, with enough power and seasons to download entire seasons off of netflix. I doubt the CRAY-2 could run a game of Snake. Either way, it speaks to the mortality of our devices, today. They will soon be lost in time, as modern as they seem now.
