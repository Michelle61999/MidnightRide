        To me, the organism has to be able reproduce, grow, and adapt to its environment. It would be simple to test reproduction. Just observe the species and chart whether it reproduces. Then, chart whether the organism grows, or changes in response to time. The last is harder to test, but I could imagine you could put the subject in different environments and see if it has a varying reaction.

        Reproduction could come about in many different forms. A computer can make duplicates of its files, but is not necessarily a living being. Inorganic matter can also grow or be compiled together. If you add to a document, it increases in size. Cache gradually will build, also. Finally, some things, living or not, will respond to different environments. A computer will melt if exposed to hot enough air.

        I would say that intelligence is the ability to aquire skills, and then apply those learned skills. A plant gains the ability of photosynthesis to feed itself. A person goes to college to get a job to use those skills. A dog learns tricks because it knows that it will get a treat.

        However, AI in video games can predict your moves, then counter with its own. A game of Dark Souls becomes steadily harder based on the player's skill to complete the game. A computer analyzes the information important to you, and then displays them on your home screen.

        Mistakes don't define intelligence. I believe it's the response to the mistake that is a true indicator of intelligence. If a person makes a mistake, but then repeats it over and over, it's not an intelligent choice. However, a person can make a mistake, like failing a test, and then go on to study the material and ace the next. It's really choices that determine intelligence.

        I don't think that it's a lack of intelligence on the machine's part. A machine's performance is the direct result of the programmer's code. If the machine fails, it relects directly back to the programmer, and their mistake in the programming. A machine is a vessel, intelligent, but ultimately dependent on who directs it.
